# "rna-ss-params", Library of RNA Secondary-structure Parameters
This library provides RNA Secondary-Structure (= SS) parameters.
These parameters are of the [Turner 2004 model](https://rna.urmc.rochester.edu/NNDB/turner04/index.html), the latest nearest-neighbor model of RNA SS free energy and enthalpy.
At present, this library provides only free-energy parameters.
