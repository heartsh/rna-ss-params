# "rna-ss-params", library of set of RNA secondary structure parameters
This library provides a set of RNA secondary structure (= SS) parameters.
This set is of the [Turner 2004 model](https://rna.urmc.rochester.edu/NNDB/turner04/index.html), the latest nearest neighbor model of RNA SS free energy and enthalpy.
